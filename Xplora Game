# Exoplanet Exploration App

## Project Description:
An open-source educational game designed to explore exoplanets located outside our solar system. The app offers an interactive and gamified experience in a 3D environment, allowing users to learn about various exoplanets through engaging gameplay, quizzes, and fascinating information about planets discovered by NASA's telescopes, such as Kepler and James Webb.

## Objectives:
- Provide an interactive and gamified educational experience about exoplanets.
- Display detailed information on the characteristics of each exoplanet.
- Enhance users' understanding of how exoplanets are discovered through fun activities and challenges.
- Make science accessible to everyone using open-source technologies.

## Expected Features:
- A simple and user-friendly interface.
- Engaging gameplay with quizzes and challenges related to exoplanets.
- Comprehensive and up-to-date information on exoplanets.
- The ability to expand and add new exoplanets and gameplay elements over time.
